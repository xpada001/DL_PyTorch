# Deep Learning with Pytorch

This is some experience with Pytorch on mainly image classification using **Deep Neural Network**, **Convolutional Neural Network** and **Transfer Learning on AlexNet and VGG16**. Also, a style transfer from one image to another is completed using VGG19 model. An example of the work is show below:

The image after style transfer can be further processed if I have more GPU resources. The original papers related to this research can be found below:
